Get customers to your business by allowing them to order a taxi to your site via Uber

== Description ==

This plugin adds either in the main text or a widget the ability to order a taxi direct from your mobile site to your business using Uber. You can encourage users to register for Uber using an optional setting as well.

The plugin hides itself if the user isn't on mobile, but users can still register for Uber.
